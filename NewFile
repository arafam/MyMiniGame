Note for next implementaions:

The game logic is complete. So, here’s a quick checklist:

Images: Replace the placeholders (basket.png, fruit.png, grenade.png) with your actual image files. Make sure they’re in the same directory as your HTML and JavaScript files.
Sounds: Replace the sound file placeholders (fruit.mp3, grenade.mp3, miss.mp3) with your sound files. These should also be in the same folder as the HTML and JS files.
Once those assets are in place, everything should work smoothly.
